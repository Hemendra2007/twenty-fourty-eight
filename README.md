# 2048 Game in Pygame

This is a simple implementation of the classic 2048 game using Python and Pygame. The game involves combining tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile. You can move tiles up, down, left, or right to achieve this goal.

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Tiles smoothly move to their new positions during each move.
- **Undo**: You can undo your previous move using the `U` key.
- **Save and Load**: The game state, including the current score and high score, can be saved and loaded.
- **Victory and Game Over**: Special screens are shown when the player wins (reaches 2048) or loses (no more moves available).
- **High Score**: Your highest score is tracked and displayed.

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. **Install Pygame**: Install the Pygame library using pip:
